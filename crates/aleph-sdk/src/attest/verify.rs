//! SEV-SNP attestation report verification: AMD certificate chain (ARK/ASK/
//! VCEK) plus the report's own ECDSA P-384/SHA-384 signature.
//!
//! This module owns exactly: parsing the raw report, the AMD chain +
//! signature check (delegated to the `sev` crate's pure-Rust `crypto_nossl`
//! backend, no OpenSSL), the VMPL policy check, and the ARK subject-identity
//! check (both of which `sev` does *not* perform). It does **not** check the
//! launch measurement or bind `report_data` to a TLS key - those live in the
//! RA-TLS handshake (a later task) which has the expected measurement and
//! public key to compare against.
//!
//! Fails closed: any parse, chain, signature, VMPL, ARK-identity,
//! validity-window, or CRL/revocation failure returns `Err`; an
//! `Ok(VerificationResult)` always means a fully verified report.
